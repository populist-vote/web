# Questions & Polls

## Discover audience insights with our engagement tools.

Populist Question embeds allow for open-form responses to questions, helping organizations understand their audiences better. Options include character limits for responses and placeholder text that shows in empty response forms.

<QuestionWidget
  embedId={getEmbedConfig()["question"].embedId}
  origin={window.location.origin}
/>

Poll embeds allow you for responses from a set of predefined answers, with the option to allow respondents to write in a response that is not represented.

<PollWidget embedId={getEmbedConfig()["poll"].embedId} origin={null} />

Both types of engagement embeds allow the option for anonymous responses, which when selected means respondents are not required to submit their name and emails.

export default function DocsQuestion({ children }) {
  return <DocsLayout currentPage="content">{children}</DocsLayout>;
