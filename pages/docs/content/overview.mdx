## Populist helps you create civic content

### What is Civic Content?

Civic content is information that helps people understand and engage
with their communities. It includes information about elections, candidates, legislation, and issues. Civic content is important because it helps people make
informed decisions and participate in their communities.

Populist sources and structures large amounts of publicly available government data and makes that data actionable and easy to use for media, governments, civic tech organizations and citizens alike.
Our mission is to make civic information more accessible and understandable for everyone.
