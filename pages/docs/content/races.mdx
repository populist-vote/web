# Races

## Visual content that shows information about a race, including candidates and election results.

Race embeds display information about a given race for a specific office, including the office name and details, and a list of candidates running for that office.

<RaceWidget
  embedId={getEmbedConfig()["race"].embedId}
  raceId={getEmbedConfig()["race"].raceId}
  origin={window.location.origin}
  renderOptions={{}}
/>

### Live Results

On election night, Populist Race embeds display live voting results as they are reported. The results will update automatically as new data is available.

export default function DocsRace({ children }) {
  return <DocsLayout currentPage="content">{children}</DocsLayout>;
}
