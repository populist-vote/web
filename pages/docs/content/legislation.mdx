# Legislation

## Keep audiences up-to-date on the latest legislation.

Legislation embeds give the latest information about bills as they move through the legislature. They help audiences easily understand what the legislation is about, who is involved, and where the bill is currently in the process of becoming law. Legislation embeds also capture engagement by allowing audiences to vote on whether they support, oppose, or are undecided on a bill.
