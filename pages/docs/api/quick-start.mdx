# API Reference

<Divider />
## Quickstart

Making a request to the Populist API is easy! To get started quickly, copy this snippet into your terminal and run it:

<CodeBlock
  code={`curl 'https://api.populist.us' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -X POST -d '{"query": "query { elections(filter: { state: CO }) { title description electionDate } }"}'`}
  language="bash"
/>

This will return a list of upcoming elections in Colorado. You can modify the `filter` object to query elections in other states or filter by other fields. For more information on the available fields and filters, check out the [API Reference](/docs/api/reference). Your output should looks something like this:

<pre className={styles.jsonBlock}>
