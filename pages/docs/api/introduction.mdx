## Introducing: The Populist public API

The Populist public API provides access to the Populist platform's
features and data. You can use the API to consume data about elections,
politicians, bills and more.

### GraphQL

The Populist public API is built on GraphQL, a query language for your
API. You can use GraphQL to query the Populist platform for the specific
data you need.

A query to the Populist API could looks something like this:

<CodeBlock
  code={`query {
    elections(filter: { state: CO }) {
      title
      description
      electionDate
    }
}`}
  language="graphql"
/>

export default function DocsApiIntroduction({ children }) {
  return <DocsLayout currentPage="api">{children}</DocsLayout>;
}
