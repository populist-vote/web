## Moderation

The conversation owner controls moderation through the admin interface.
Each new comment can be approved, rejected, or left unmoderated. While
Conversations work without moderation, moderating effectively saves
participants' time by removing irrelevant content.

## Moderation Schemes

Strict Moderation (Default) Works like a whitelist Comments only appear
after moderator approval. Recommended when embedding on your website to
prevent inappropriate content. Permissive Moderation Works like a
blacklist Comments appear immediately Can be removed later by moderators
You can switch between these in the conversation's admin configuration.

export default function DocsConversationsModeration({ children }) {
  return <DocsLayout currentPage="conversations">{children}</DocsLayout>;
}
