## What is a Conversation?

Populist's **Conversations** is an open-source platform that helps large groups share and understand their collective views. It is an implementation of a [Wikisurvey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki_survey) and inspired by other platforms including [Pol.is](https://pol.is) with a few key improvements.

When using Populist conversations, people write short comments and then vote on other people's comments by selecting support, oppose, or neutral. The system shows comments to voters in a semi-random way to ensure broad exposure of ideas.

What makes this different from regular surveys:

- Participants create the content themselves instead of answering preset questions
- People can contribute meaningfully without having to vote on everything
- The system works efficiently even with hundreds, thousands, or potentially millions of participants

#### Participating in Conversations

Browse through the list of existing conversations to find topics that interest you. Click on a conversation to view the discussion and contribute your thoughts and opinions.

#### Managing Conversations

Organization administrators have the ability to manage conversations, including editing or deleting conversations as needed. This ensures that discussions remain relevant and appropriate for the organization.
