It is an implementation of a [Wikisurvey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki_survey) and inspired by other platforms including [Pol.is](https://pol.is) with a few key improvements.\n\nWhen using Populist conversations, people write short comments and then vote on other people's comments by selecting support, oppose, or neutral. The system shows comments to voters in a semi-random way to ensure broad exposure of ideas.\n\nWhat makes this different from regular surveys:\n\n- Participants create the content themselves instead of answering preset questions\n- People can contribute meaningfully without having to vote on everything\n- The system works efficiently even with hundreds, thousands, or potentially millions of participants\n\n#### Participating in Conversations\n\nBrowse through the list of existing conversations to find topics that interest you. Click on a conversation to view the discussion and contribute your thoughts and opinions.\n\n#### Managing Conversations\n\nOrganization administrators have the ability to manage conversations, including editing or deleting conversations as needed. This ensures that discussions remain relevant and appropriate for the organization.\n\nexport default function DocsConversationsOverview({ children }) {\n  return <DocsLayout currentPage=\"conversations\">{children}</DocsLayout>;\n}\n",

You can use the API to consume data about elections,\npoliticians, bills and more.\n\n### GraphQL\n\nThe Populist public API is built on GraphQL, a query language for your\nAPI. You can use GraphQL to query the Populist platform for the specific\ndata you need.\n\nA query to the Populist API could looks something like this:\n\n<CodeBlock\n  code={`query {\n            elections(filter: {\n            state: CO\n            }) {\n            title\n            description\n            electionDate\n          }\n        }`}\n  language=\"graphql\"\n/>\n\nexport default function DocsApiIntroduction({ children }) {\n  return <DocsLayout currentPage=\"api\">{children}</DocsLayout>;\n}\n",

To get started quickly, copy this snippet into your terminal and run it:\n\n<CodeBlock\n  code={`curl 'https://api.populist.us' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -X POST -d '{\"query\": \"query { elections(filter: { state: CO }) { title description electionDate } }\"}'`}\n  language=\"bash\"\n/>\n\nThis will return a list of upcoming elections in Colorado. You can modify the `filter` object to query elections in other states or filter by other fields. For more information on the available fields and filters, check out the [API Reference](/docs/api/reference). Your output should looks something like this:\n\n<pre className={styles.jsonBlock}>\n  {`{\n  \"data\": {\n    \"elections\": [\n      {\n        \"title\": \"Colorado Primaries\",\n        \"description\": \"Primary races for the general election later this year on November 8, 2022.\",\n        \"electionDate\": \"2022-06-28\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"title\": \"General Election\",\n        \"description\": \"During this midterm election year, all 435 seats in the U.S. House of Representatives and 35 of the 100 seats in the U.S. Senate will be contested.
